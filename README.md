# Learn Rust

This repository contains a collection of small Rust projects created while learning the language. Each project is a separate crate that explores different concepts of Rust.

## File Structure & Crates

The repository is structured into the following crates:

*   `branches`: Demonstrates control flow with `if`, `else`, and different types of loops.
*   `functions`: Shows how to define and use functions, including parameters and return values.
*   `guessing_game`: A simple game that introduces concepts like external dependencies (crates), user input, and random number generation.
*   `hello_cargo`: The classic "Hello, world!" program to get started with Cargo.
*   `variables`: Explores variables, constants, data types, and compound types.
